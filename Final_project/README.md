## Final Project Ideas

1. Change the topology of a protein using RFDiffusion and ProteinMPNN
   - cut out the loops and change which elements are looped
2. Create a fusion protein
   - orient two proteins relative to one another using PyMol, save a PDB, then use this PDB with RFDiffusion 
3. Redesign a natural protein using ProteinMPNN and see if AF2 predicts the structure in single seq mode.
   -  if this works, what are the nature of the amino acid mutations?
