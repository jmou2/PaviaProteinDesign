## Final Project Presentations

Each of you will have 10 minutes to present your project results. An example outline could be:
- An introduction to your design problem and why it is important. If you are using a natural protein, what does it do?
- Results of your design problem. What did you try? What structures were generated?
- Analysis of your results. What is the AlphaFold pLDDT and RMSD?

You may make 3-4 slides and/or PyMol scenes.

To make a scene, type `scene scene_name, store` in PyMol and an icon called `scene_name` will be created on the bottom left. This scene stores the position, coloring, and visible portions of your PyMol session. You will also want to save your pymol session: "save" --> "save session as" . This will create a `.pse` file that you can open in PyMol.
