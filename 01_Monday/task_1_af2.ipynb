    "Our goal in this task is to understand how to make, use and analyze AlphaFold 2 (AF2) predictions of protein strucutres. Alphafold is a deep learning model that gives a single (or multiple ranked) protein structure(s) when given the amino acid sequence of a protein. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the primary use of AF2 in many biology labs is to predict the structures of proteins without a solved structure, numerous publications have now shown that it can be used to predict the stability of a designed protein. By folding the structure without any Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) information, otherwise known as single-sequence-mode, we can understand how confidently a particular sequence folds into its cognate structure. Proteins that are confidently predicted to fold into the correct structure with a low RMSD are often more stable, monomeric, and soluble in the lab. \n"
