### Tutorial 1 - Introduction to Pymol and ProDy

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Pymol and ProDy, two common tools for viewing, analyzing, and manipulating protein structures. 

If you do not already have Pymol downloaded, install it here: https://pymol.org/

Pymol has an excellent beginner's guide here: https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Practical_Pymol_for_Beginners

Another useful resource is the cheat sheet: https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/CheatSheet 

Once you feel confident using pymol, proceed to the "Intro to ProDy notebook" in the slides/links column above. 


### Task 1 - Judging electron density and analyzing an AlphaFolded structure

In the first part of task 1, you will analyze the electron density of a structure in pymol. You may choose from the following PDB IDs: 

| PDB ID | problem | 
|---|---|
| ABCD 1 | problem description |
| ABCD 1 | problem description |
| ABCD 1 | problem description |
| ABCD 1 | problem description |

In the second part of task 1, you will choose a solved crystral structure, AlphaFold it in single sequence mode, and align and calculate the RMSD using ProDy. Use the "Analyzing an AlphaFolded structure" notebook in the slides/links column above.
