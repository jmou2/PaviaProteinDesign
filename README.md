## Learning Materials
Learning materials will be distributed through this github repository. Materials including slides, links, tutorials, and tasks will be added before the day's lesson in the appropriate folder. Further instructions for each day's activities, including a schedule, will be in each folder.

## Setup

We will be using Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) to run Jupyter notebooks in Python. Google Colab is a cloud-based, free Jupyter notebook environment, and the notebooks can be downloaded if you prefer to run with a local Jupyter installation. All you need to use Google Colab is a Google account.

Click "Open in Colab" badge on the top of each `.ipynb` notebook (no need to install anything for Python).

If you are running the notebook on Google Colab, please make a copy of the notebook to your drive:

Click "Copy to Drive"
Or navigate to "File -> Save a copy in Drive"
Or navigate to "File -> Download" and save a local copy
Or else your changes in the playground mode will get lost after you close the page.
