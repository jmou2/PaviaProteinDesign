## Setup

We will be using Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) to run Jupyter notebooks in Python. Google Colab is a cloud-based, free Jupyter notebook environment, and the notebooks can be downloaded if you prefer to run with a local Jupyter installation. All you need to use Google Colab is a Google account.

Click "Open in Colab" badge on the top of each `.ipynb` notebook (no need to install anything for Python).

If you are running the notebook on Google Colab, please make a copy of the notebook to your drive:

Click "Copy to Drive"
Or navigate to "File -> Save a copy in Drive"
Or navigate to "File -> Download" and save a local copy
Or else your changes in the playground mode will get lost after you close the page.
